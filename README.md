# PCHERO Website

This fictional website was coded with normal PHP. I just started to learn PHP and had no idea about OOP at all, so this project is without OOP, but it is just good and almost explains itself. The whole project is in English, but the comments are in German! I am providing this project because I had problems with PHP in the beginning myself.
